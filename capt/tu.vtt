00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:06.589
Tourette syndrome is a medical condition

2
00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:08.580
that

3
00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.070
people live within their daily lives

4
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.340
they make involuntary sounds known as

5
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.220
tics it could be a sound or a movement

6
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.550
that the body cannot control I have this

7
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.750
one sometimes I click my tongue in the

8
00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.670
back of my throat like this but not very

9
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.830
awesome and I constantly crack my

10
00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.230
knuckles even if I did so they mostly

11
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.970
mostly would ask me like like why like

12
00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:37.470
like why I'm lying my eyes keep

13
00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.600
twitching or like we're asking or asking

14
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.100
me if like my let if I can stop like

15
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.680
moving might like the tics the ticks

16
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.479
were more that were more like the head

17
00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:51.449
shaking as well barking I started taking

18
00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.269
went for a while where I just stepped

19
00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:55.860
backwards and walked backwards for a

20
00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.949
couple of steps and then walk back I had

21
00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.440
to take once when I was when I'd be

22
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.600
standing and I'd lift up my leg when I

23
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.869
was first diagnosed I was out of school

24
00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.520
for weeks my tics were very high there

25
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.180
my vocal tics were elevated my motor

26
00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.770
tics would really hurt me it was tough

27
00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.360
you know

28
00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.520
seven or so years old I was responding

29
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.040
well is this just gonna keep on no

30
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.840
hunger they like singled me out and and

31
00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.960
tree didn't me more as you know it

32
00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.780
basically almost as I was like an alien

33
00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.550
in a sense and in it because at that

34
00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:39.930
point in time I didn't really understand

35
00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.790
much about what was happening you have a

36
00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.730
seven year old when I take him to school

37
00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:47.280
and I go down the elevator right before

38
00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.690
we got on the elevator I'll take my

39
00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:50.580
teeth and I'll bang my teeth against the

40
00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.310
wall and he asked me what are you doing

41
00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.800
dad so I said oh I have Suresh syndrome

42
00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.500
is a condition that causes me to do

43
00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.870
things I don't want to do and so it's

44
00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.729
the funny thing is the other day he

45
00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.680
comes up to me and we're standing there

46
00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:05.520
and I don't

47
00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.128
the elevator and he said it's a t8 into

48
00:02:08.128 --> 00:02:11.400
your Tourette's and I'm like no it's not

49
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.170
it's not like that it didn't work that

50
00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.840
way it's hard to suppress a dick and

51
00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.879
even if you do suppress a tick when

52
00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:19.260
you're done suppressing the tick they

53
00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.900
only come out more I have some morph my

54
00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.049
words instead of saying Bom Bom Bom I go

55
00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:29.010
pop pop if I try to suppress them they

56
00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.440
it doesn't work that's like trying to

57
00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.730
hold in a sneeze young girls would laugh

58
00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.860
kind of embarrassing for an adult to be

59
00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.180
bullied by a young teenagers as a young

60
00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.519
kid I would I you know take whatever it

61
00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:46.920
was and immediately look around to see

62
00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.200
who who noticed you know like as if it

63
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.360
really mattered and then so then you

64
00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.410
really start to believe that you are

65
00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.510
different I would be out on the subway

66
00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.209
and attracting attention from other

67
00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.340
people adults and like learning about

68
00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.880
how cruel people can be seeing those

69
00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.040
kids in DC at the conference treating

70
00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.860
their tics as as something that was just

71
00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.319
you know part of who they are was so

72
00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:12.480
inspiring it's really cool kids don't

73
00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.519
get judged there and they have fun with

74
00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:16.590
other kids like them other than our tics

75
00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.359
were normal or normal people because

76
00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:19.680
everyone has their own things that may

77
00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:20.730
then make them different from one

78
00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.709
another and threats interests happens to

79
00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:24.090
be one of those things for some people

80
00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.880
don't be afraid of people with

81
00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.000
disabilities just because someone has a

82
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.700
disability doesn't mean that you have to

83
00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.500
avoid them I think the Tourette

84
00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.870
Association of America means support and

85
00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.359
community my hope is that everyone who

86
00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:41.190
sees this video goes home and tells

87
00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.450
three people about Tourette's syndrome

88
00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.200
you
