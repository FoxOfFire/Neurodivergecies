00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:09,290
Autism, also known as autism spectrum disorder,
is characterized by symptoms that include

2
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:15,200
impairments in social communication and interaction
and restricted and repetitive behaviors.

3
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,170
Although the neuroscience of autism is still
poorly understood, autism is considered to

4
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:24,070
be a complex developmental disorder that involves
atypical brain organization starting early

5
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:26,360
in development.

6
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:30,640
Individuals with autism often experience a
period of unusually rapid brain growth in

7
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,070
infancy and early childhood.

8
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:37,020
This accelerated brain growth is linked to
an atypical pattern of connectivity between

9
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:38,710
brain regions.

10
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:42,870
A number of studies report that alterations
in brain circuitry involved with social interaction

11
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:47,670
and attention can be detected well before
the symptoms of autism begin to appear.

12
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:52,170
At this point, however, it’s unclear how
brain overgrowth and atypical connectivity

13
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:56,010
might be linked to the occurrence of autism
symptoms.

14
00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:00,250
Research suggests that the risk of autism
is strongly influenced by genetics, yet studies

15
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:04,370
consistently report that environmental factors
also play a large role.

16
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:08,100
Although a number of potential environmental
factors have been identified, the risk factors

17
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:12,359
for autism are far from definitive, and it
remains unclear which factors are responsible

18
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:17,630
for causing an increase in autism risk, and
which are associated in a non-causal way.

19
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:21,240
The risk factors that are most strongly linked
to autism are associated with the prenatal

20
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,569
or perinatal period.

21
00:01:22,569 --> 00:01:27,479
Thus, it’s possible they might be responsible
for disruptions to typical neural development,

22
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:30,810
leading to symptoms of autism months or years
later.

23
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:34,240
How these risk factors might interfere with
neural development is still uncertain, but

24
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:39,749
hypotheses have suggested potential mechanisms
such as epigenetic effects, inflammation,

25
00:01:39,749 --> 00:01:43,729
oxidative stress, or damage caused by oxygen
deficiency.

26
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:47,539
More work needs to be done, however, to fully
elucidate the genetic and environmental risk

27
00:01:47,539 --> 00:01:51,679
factors for autism, as well as the mechanisms
for the development of autism symptoms.
