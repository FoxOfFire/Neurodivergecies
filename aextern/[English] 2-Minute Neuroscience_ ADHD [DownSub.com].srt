00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:08,080
Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD,  

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:13,200
is a condition characterized by difficulties with 
attention and/or hyperactivity and impulsivity.  

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:19,280
ADHD involves strong genetic influences, but 
environmental factors, and interactions between  

4
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:23,040
genetics and the environment, are thought 
to play an important role in ADHD as well.

5
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:29,200
Much of the recent research into the neuroscience 
of ADHD has focused on understanding the brain  

6
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:33,200
networks that might underlie different 
aspects of cognitive function in ADHD.  

7
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,680
One example is the default mode network, 
which is a collection of brain regions  

8
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,240
that is more active during mind-wandering and 
introspection, and less active when a person  

9
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:47,120
is attempting to complete a specific task. 
Studies have found that people with ADHD have  

10
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,920
atypical connectivity in the default mode network, 
which might be associated with distractibility.

11
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,800
Individuals with ADHD also display 
lower activity in brain networks  

12
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,920
that are involved in attention and cognitive 
control. Typically, activity in these networks  

13
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,760
increases when activity in the default 
mode network decreases, and vice versa.  

14
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:12,000
Thus, one hypothesis is that in ADHD activity 
in the default mode network is dysregulated  

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,080
and interferes with the function of networks 
involved in attention and cognitive control.

16
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:23,040
Studies have also found that people with ADHD tend 
to display atypical activity in the reward system,  

17
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,080
a group of structures that are 
involved in motivated behavior,  

18
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,960
anticipation, and reinforced learning. 
This atypical reward system activity  

19
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,880
might be associated with a tendency to 
overestimate the value of short-term rewards  

20
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,040
in comparison to long-term rewards, which 
could also affect planning and decision-making.  

21
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,920
The reward system includes some of the major 
dopamine pathways in the brain, and dopamine is  

22
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,800
often implicated in ADHD because medications that 
are commonly used to treat the condition, such as  

23
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:53,840
amphetamine and methylphenidate, cause increased 
transmission of dopamine and norepinephrine.
