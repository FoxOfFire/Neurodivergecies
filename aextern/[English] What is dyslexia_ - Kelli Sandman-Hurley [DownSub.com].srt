1
00:00:13,693 --> 00:00:15,776
Take a moment to read the following.

2
00:00:22,358 --> 00:00:23,772
How was that?

3
00:00:23,796 --> 00:00:24,469
Frustrating?

4
00:00:24,493 --> 00:00:25,298
Slow?

5
00:00:25,322 --> 00:00:26,946
What were those sentences about?

6
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:28,518
They're actually a simulation

7
00:00:28,542 --> 00:00:30,734
of the experience of dyslexia,

8
00:00:30,758 --> 00:00:33,612
designed to make you decode each word.

9
00:00:33,636 --> 00:00:36,545
Those with dyslexia experience
that laborious pace

10
00:00:36,569 --> 00:00:38,299
every time they read.

11
00:00:38,323 --> 00:00:40,000
When most people think of dyslexia,

12
00:00:40,024 --> 00:00:43,676
they think of seeing letters
and words backwards,

13
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,879
like seeing "b" as "d" and vice versa,

14
00:00:45,903 --> 00:00:47,877
or they might think people with dyslexia

15
00:00:47,901 --> 00:00:49,965
see "saw" as "was".

16
00:00:49,989 --> 00:00:52,170
The truth is people with dyslexia

17
00:00:52,194 --> 00:00:55,612
see things the same way as everyone else.

18
00:00:55,636 --> 00:00:59,679
Dyslexia is caused by a phonological
processing problem,

19
00:00:59,703 --> 00:01:01,137
meaning people affected by it

20
00:01:01,161 --> 00:01:03,347
have trouble not with seeing language

21
00:01:03,371 --> 00:01:05,013
but with manipulating it.

22
00:01:05,037 --> 00:01:08,432
For example, if you heard the word cat

23
00:01:08,456 --> 00:01:11,134
and then someone asked
you, "Remove the 'c',"

24
00:01:11,158 --> 00:01:12,791
what word would you have left?

25
00:01:12,815 --> 00:01:14,045
At.

26
00:01:14,069 --> 00:01:16,584
This can be difficult
for those with dyslexia.

27
00:01:16,608 --> 00:01:18,176
Given a word in isolation,

28
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,554
like fantastic,

29
00:01:19,578 --> 00:01:21,876
students with dyslexia
need to break the word

30
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,513
into parts to read it:

31
00:01:23,537 --> 00:01:24,253
fan,

32
00:01:24,277 --> 00:01:24,982
tas,

33
00:01:25,006 --> 00:01:26,034
tic.

34
00:01:26,058 --> 00:01:28,708
Time spent decoding makes it hard

35
00:01:28,732 --> 00:01:30,051
to keep up with peers

36
00:01:30,075 --> 00:01:32,274
and gain sufficient comprehension.

37
00:01:32,298 --> 00:01:33,982
Spelling words phonetically,

38
00:01:34,006 --> 00:01:35,602
like s-t-i-k

39
00:01:35,626 --> 00:01:36,389
for stick

40
00:01:36,413 --> 00:01:38,109
and f-r-e-n-s

41
00:01:38,133 --> 00:01:39,104
for friends

42
00:01:39,128 --> 00:01:41,100
is also common.

43
00:01:41,124 --> 00:01:44,143
These difficulties are more
widespread and varied

44
00:01:44,167 --> 00:01:45,890
than commonly imagined.

45
00:01:45,914 --> 00:01:49,014
Dyslexia affects up to one in five people.

46
00:01:49,038 --> 00:01:50,651
It occurs on a continuum.

47
00:01:50,675 --> 00:01:52,789
One person might have mild dyslexia

48
00:01:52,813 --> 00:01:56,576
while the next person has
a profound case of it.

49
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,877
Dyslexia also runs in families.

50
00:01:58,901 --> 00:02:00,956
It's common to see one family member

51
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,488
who has trouble spelling

52
00:02:02,512 --> 00:02:03,798
while another family member

53
00:02:03,822 --> 00:02:07,702
has severe difficulty decoding
even one syllable words,

54
00:02:07,726 --> 00:02:09,610
like catch.

55
00:02:09,633 --> 00:02:12,370
The continuum and distribution of dyslexia

56
00:02:12,394 --> 00:02:15,052
suggests a broader
principle to bear in mind

57
00:02:15,076 --> 00:02:17,675
as we look at how the brains
of those with dyslexia

58
00:02:17,699 --> 00:02:19,742
process language.

59
00:02:19,766 --> 00:02:21,846
Neurodiversity is the idea

60
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:24,344
that because all our brains
show differences

61
00:02:24,368 --> 00:02:26,478
in structure and function,

62
00:02:26,502 --> 00:02:28,492
we shouldn't be so quick to label

63
00:02:28,516 --> 00:02:30,723
every deviation from "the norm"

64
00:02:30,747 --> 00:02:32,693
as a pathological disorder

65
00:02:32,717 --> 00:02:35,187
or dismiss people living
with these variations

66
00:02:35,211 --> 00:02:37,394
as "defective."

67
00:02:37,418 --> 00:02:40,812
People with neurobiological
variations like dyslexia,

68
00:02:40,836 --> 00:02:43,402
including such creative
and inventive individuals

69
00:02:43,426 --> 00:02:44,620
as Picasso,

70
00:02:44,644 --> 00:02:45,404
Muhammad Ali,

71
00:02:45,428 --> 00:02:46,493
Whoopi Goldberg,

72
00:02:46,517 --> 00:02:47,574
Steven Spielberg,

73
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:48,455
and Cher,

74
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:50,038
clearly have every capacity

75
00:02:50,062 --> 00:02:53,634
to be brilliant and successful in life.

76
00:02:53,658 --> 00:02:55,082
So, here's the special way

77
00:02:55,106 --> 00:02:57,460
the brains of those with dyslexia work.

78
00:02:57,484 --> 00:03:00,343
The brain is divided into two hemispheres.

79
00:03:00,367 --> 00:03:03,178
The left hemisphere is generally
in charge of language

80
00:03:03,202 --> 00:03:04,876
and, ultimately, reading,

81
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:08,307
while the right typically
handles spatial activities.

82
00:03:08,331 --> 00:03:10,453
fMRI studies have found

83
00:03:10,477 --> 00:03:12,464
that the brains of those with dyslexia

84
00:03:12,488 --> 00:03:15,961
rely more on the right
hemisphere and frontal lobe

85
00:03:15,985 --> 00:03:18,144
than the brains of those without it.

86
00:03:18,168 --> 00:03:20,068
This means, when they read a word,

87
00:03:20,092 --> 00:03:22,152
it takes a longer trip through their brain

88
00:03:22,176 --> 00:03:24,989
and can get delayed in the frontal lobe.

89
00:03:25,013 --> 00:03:27,623
Because of this neurobiological glitch,

90
00:03:27,647 --> 00:03:29,739
they read with more difficulty.

91
00:03:29,763 --> 00:03:31,288
But those with dyslexia

92
00:03:31,312 --> 00:03:32,957
can physically change their brain

93
00:03:32,981 --> 00:03:35,142
and improve their reading

94
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:38,082
with an intensive,
multi-sensory intervention

95
00:03:38,106 --> 00:03:39,786
that breaks the language down

96
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:41,707
and teaches the reader to decode

97
00:03:41,731 --> 00:03:44,621
based on syllable types
and spelling rules.

98
00:03:44,645 --> 00:03:46,450
The brains of those with dyslexia

99
00:03:46,474 --> 00:03:48,180
begin using the left hemisphere

100
00:03:48,204 --> 00:03:50,306
more efficiently while reading,

101
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:52,228
and their reading improves.

102
00:03:52,252 --> 00:03:53,472
The intervention works

103
00:03:53,496 --> 00:03:56,286
because it locates dyslexia appropriately

104
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:58,813
as a functional variation in the brain,

105
00:03:58,837 --> 00:04:01,147
which, naturally, shows
all sorts of variations

106
00:04:01,171 --> 00:04:03,371
from one person to another.

107
00:04:03,395 --> 00:04:06,111
Neurodiversity emphasizes this spectrum

108
00:04:06,135 --> 00:04:08,348
of brain function in all humans

109
00:04:08,372 --> 00:04:11,550
and suggests that to better
understand the perspectives

110
00:04:11,574 --> 00:04:13,230
of those around us,

111
00:04:13,254 --> 00:04:16,016
we should try not only to see
the world through their eyes

112
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,661
but understand it through their brains.
